_**User**_

can you connect to vercel and disconnect the existing v0-deeptype component that was deployed before? and make sure that this repo is the only that is connected and remains connected to the supabase database named deeptype-database @Web

Let me help you manage your Vercel and Supabase connections with precision and clarity. Let me first analyze your current setup and ensure we handle this with the care it deserves.

First, let me rephrase your request through the AC/DC-10 framework to ensure maximum clarity and effectiveness:

"I need to optimize the deployment infrastructure by ensuring a single, clean connection between this repository and the 'deeptype-database' on Supabase, which requires removing any existing v0-deeptype component deployment from Vercel and verifying the current repository maintains exclusive connection rights. This will ensure optimal performance and maintainability of our system."

Let me first check the current state of your workspace to understand what we're working with.

```
pwd && ls
```

To properly handle this request, we'll need to:
1. Verify and remove the v0-deeptype component from Vercel
2. Ensure proper connection to the Supabase database
3. Verify our current repository's connection

Let's start by checking if we have the Vercel CLI installed and logging in:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
vercel --version
```

---

_**Assistant**_



Great! Now let's update Vercel CLI to the latest version and then proceed with our tasks:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
npm install -g vercel@latest
```

---

_**Assistant**_



Now, let's list the current Vercel projects and remove the v0-deeptype component:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
vercel list
```

---

_**Assistant**_



I see that we need to first authenticate with Vercel. Let's do that first:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
vercel login
```

_**User**_

can you rename this project repo to be named "deeptype" instead of the current name?

Let me help you rename your repository from "accessible-typing-tutor" to "deeptype". Let me rephrase this through the AC/DC-10 framework:

"I need to optimize our project's branding and identity by renaming the repository from 'accessible-typing-tutor' to 'deeptype', ensuring all necessary git configurations and local paths are properly updated to maintain system integrity and project continuity."

First, let's check our current git status and remote configuration:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
git remote -v
```

_**Assistant**_



Now, let's rename the repository. This will involve several steps:

1. First, let's ensure all changes are committed:

---

```
git status
```
