Let me help analyze the current state of the project. However, I notice I don't have direct access to the codebase or PRD document. To provide an accurate assessment, I'll need you to:

1. Share the current file structure using:
```bash
tree -L 3
```

2. Share the location of and contents of the PRD document using:
```bash
pwd && ls
```

3. Share any specific documentation or requirements you'd like me to review.

This approach aligns with our principles of thorough analysis before implementation, ensuring we build something that's not just functional but also aesthetically pleasing and user-centric.

Let me enhance your question through the AC/DC-10 framework:

"Could you help perform a comprehensive project state analysis by:
1. Examining the current codebase architecture and structure
2. Reviewing the PRD requirements and success criteria
3. Identifying any gaps between current implementation and desired outcomes
4. Assessing the UI/UX alignment with our minimalist and aesthetic principles
5. Evaluating the technical stack implementation quality
6. Checking for performance optimization opportunities
7. Verifying TypeScript type safety and code quality
8. Reviewing component modularity and reusability
9. Analyzing the current state of responsive design
10. Checking integration of Aceternity UI, Shadcn UI, and other specified technologies"

Please provide the requested information, and I'll give you a detailed analysis that considers both technical excellence and design aesthetics while keeping your 10-year-old cousin engaged with clear explanations.
