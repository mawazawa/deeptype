please traverse the entire repo and give me a thorough state of the repo report and also read the PRD document and tell me where we are and where we need to go and then tell me what stands between where we are and a world class world-best app in its class. @Web @Codebase

Let me analyze the repository and provide a comprehensive assessment following the AC/DC-10 framework.

**Enhanced Question (10x):**
"Could you provide a detailed architectural and implementation gap analysis of the current codebase against the PRD requirements, specifically highlighting the critical path components needed to achieve market leadership in accessible typing education software, with concrete next steps and technical recommendations?"

First, let's examine the current repository structure:

```bash
pwd && ls -la
```

Based on the provided codebase context, here's my thorough analysis:

### 1. Current State Assessment

#### Documentation & Requirements
- We have a comprehensive PRD document (referencing PRD.md, lines 153-192) that outlines:
  - Core accessibility features
  - Voice command system
  - Progress tracking
  - Content variety & gamification
  - Technical stack decisions

#### Technical Architecture
The planned architecture (referencing README.md, lines 221-226) defines a layered approach:
- UI Layer (React components)
- Logic Layer (lesson management, state)
- Platform Services Layer
- Backend API Layer

#### Current Implementation Gaps

1. **Core Infrastructure**
- Missing initial project setup with
